You’ve done your research and got the best pack, the warmest bag, and the right shelter. Now you’re ready to take the plunge and venture off on your first multi-day backpacking adventure. All you have to do is grab your food and you’re ready to hit the trail.

Meal planning is one of the most important considerations for any backpacking trip. The food you choose will depend on taste preference, nutritional value, the caloric density of each meal, and how easy it is to cook. Here are some quick answers to common questions about meal planning for backpacking trips.

1. How much food should you take?

Amount of food that you should take when backpacking depends on several things. You need to consider factors such as trip length, body weight, intensity level, climate, group size, and where you are sleeping.

Generally, a hiker needs anywhere from 3000 to 6000 calories per day per person. It’s around 0.8kg to 1.3kg of food per day. A person covering a few miles of the relatively flat trail who plans to chill at the campsite needs fewer calories than a person doing 15km miles of hard hiking with a 1km climb.

Meals can be much simpler if you’re going solo. If you’re traveling with a group there may be consequences. Having each person responsible for one backpacking meal is a nice way to break up dinner duty and help streamline the meal planning process. It’s better to consider there might be some big eaters in the bunch.

If you’re clocking many miles over rough terrain one day, you may want to load up on snacks that you can eat on the go and plan easily dinner that night.

Not enough food and you may feel too sluggish to continue the journey so It’s better to pack a little bit more but not too much. Extra food equals unnecessary weight.

2. What food should you bring?

Though you can take many types of food for backpacking, it’s better to stick with foods that are portable, light weight and not too bulky. You can prepare a dehydrated meal at home, buy ready-to-eat dehydrated meals that only require adding hot water, or assemble your meal from a mixture of fresh and dry ingredients. Follow the tips below when deciding what food to pack.

* Bring what you like to eat – Take food that you love to eat and will look forward to enjoying at the end of the hike.
* Do variations – Try to balance flavors (salty, sour, sweet, spicy), textures (soft, crunchy, crispy), and nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, and fats.).
* Add some fresh foods – Consider pick item’s that won’t perish easily (carrots, onion, hard cheese, apples, oranges)
* Look for lightweight versions of food –instant noodles, pasta, readymade samaposha. Chocolate and energy bars, Nuts, biscuits and snacks
* Take some spices - Spices can boost the appeal of backpacking food with minimal additional weight. Bring whatever essential to your home kitchen.
* Stay hydrated with flavored beverages – Consider taking tea, chai, coffee instant soup with you
* Dehydrate your own meal – Dehydrating your meal takes more time and preparation, but it can save you money as well as weight and volume in your pack. We’ll teach you how to dehydrate your meal from another article.

* Consider instant food – There are several ready to eat meals in the market for hikers. Add hot water and wait for the food to rehydrate. They are relatively pricey, but you can find a lot of decent options to suit your taste, even gluten-free and vegan backpacking food.

3. How to plan food for backpacking?

Roughly sketch your meal starting with dinners and breakfasts, which generally are the biggest meals of the day and the ones you are likely to sit down for. Plan the meals with respect to the activities you are going to be doing and it’s better to eat the fresh items earlier in the trip.

Following is a sample of low weight food to bring on a 3-day hike.
