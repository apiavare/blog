You might be a traveler who’s hiking in the backcountry and wondering how could it possibly harmful to drink that pristine-looking water over there. Remember, even though how perfect that mountain stream looks, we can’t assure it is harboring a gut-seeking microbe or not. 

### What makes you sick?

These are the most common waterborne pathogens found in water sources,

#### **Bacteria:**

* A single-celled organism, which infects humans through contaminated water. E-coli and salmonella are some of the most common bacteria.        
* Cause intestinal (enteric) infections such as Typhoid. Symptoms would be fever, headache, abdominal pain and even can cause diarrhea.

#### **Viruses:**

* Waterborne viruses are generally not an issue for backcountry travel in Sri Lanka. But can be found in coastal areas especially in Ampara district.
* Cause infections such as Hepatitis A and B. Symptoms be yellow discoloration of eyes, fever, abdominal pain and weakness.

#### **Protozoa:**

* Most common waterborne protozoa types include Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Entameba histolytica. 
* Cause diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, amebic dysentery.

#### **Parasitic worms:**

* Not commonly transmitted through drinking water, but it is a potential means of transmission for some.

The coastal areas of Ampara District (Sainthamaruthu, Karaitivu, Akkaraipattu, Irakkamam, varipathanchenai, Palamunai, Oluvil and Nintavu) face a lot of challenges by these water-borne diseases.

Yet you might find people who claim they have been happily drinking untreated backcountry water for years. This is possible if they have especially robust immune systems. Still, they carry these microbiological creatures with them to each and every new campsite.

**Prevention is better than cure.** Thus, the best practice is to treat water from any source before you drink, as what the most perceptive backpackers do. 

## Water Treatment Tips:

Follow the below tips to get safe drinkable water at your campsite.

#### **1. Finding a water source:**

* Flowing water from a stream or river will be the best option. It isn’t conducive to the growth of algae or other accumulation of microorganisms.
* If no clear flowing water, then look for calm water (a lake, a pool, a slow-moving stream) without a lot of sediment and silt.
* After heavy rainfall, do not rush to gather water from any source. Because rain may have washed surface material into them, increasing bacterial, and mud contamination in loads.

#### **2. Gathering water:**

* Seek out for the clearest possible spot in your water source.
* Gather from the surface. Scoop water from near the surface of the least murky section of water.
* Use a prefilter. If you’re not using a filter, strain water through a bandanna before treating.

#### **3.  Water Treatment Techniques:**

* **Boiling** is a bit old school but still an effective method of treating water. The  Heat will kill most of the common intestinal pathogens at 60-70<sup>0 </sup>  C, well below the boiling point. However, boiling the water to the boiling point for 1 minute allows a margin of safety. Although the boiling point decreases with altitude, at common terrestrial travel elevations it is still well above the temperature required to inactivate enteric pathogens.

* **Water Filters** are used for water treatment by most international travelers. Portable hand-pump or gravity-drip filters with different pore sizes are available commercially. Filters with pore sizes between 0.1 and 0.4 microns can remove bacteria but not the viruses. Reverse osmosis filters remove bacteria, viruses and even salt from water.

* **Chemical water treatment**, tablets or packets to disinfect water are too favorite among lightweight backpackers. These usually combine chemical disinfectants (such as chlorine or iodine) with a substance that makes the water clear and improves its taste. You need to follow the instructions on the package closely when using it.

* **UV light lamps/pens** are another quick way of purifying water. This is effective to disinfect small quantities of clear water. UV light disrupts the DNA of bacteria, parasites and viruses. However, this technique is less effective in cloudy water because small particles may shield germs from the light.
