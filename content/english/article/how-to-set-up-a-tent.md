The tent is an essential and useful camping gear for backpackers. But some frustrated campers undergo many difficulties when trying to set it up in the darkness after a tiring hike. However, if you’ve set up a tent several times, and it became a familiar routine that can easily be repeated even in the most difficult hiking and camping conditions. This article will help you out to practice and smoothen your tent setting skills to ensure a better camping experience.
Follow the below steps to set up your tent properly.

## Pre-trip preparation

Set up your tent at home reading the instructions carefully, before hitting the trail. It prevents confusion and damage to tent parts. Even though if a part is missing, you’ve built it in the time to get it before your trip. And don’t forget
to pack along a copy of the instructions.

## Selecting a campsite

You could follow this set of practices when selecting a better campsite to set up your tent.

* In well-travelled areas, seek out existing campsites.
* Always camp at least 200 feet away from lakes and streams.
* Keep the campsite as small as possible. An area where the vegetation is absent be the best.
* Avoid the pristine area as much as possible to prevent the creation of new campsites.

Tips : Even though you are using a quality tent that can handle both wind and rain, selecting a site that offers some natural protection could minimize the stresses and hazards that could cause.

### To prevent wind-related issues

* Look for natural windbreaks : a stand of trees or a hill between you and the prevailing breeze.
* Avoid camping near damaged trees or limbs that can be blown down by a severe gust.
* Though many campers will orient a tent with the smaller side facing the wind for reduced resistance, it’s more important to place the side that has the strongest pole structure facing the wind.
* If you’re camping in a hot climate, orient a door toward the wind for cooling.

### To prevent water-related issues

Seek higher, drier ground so you have less moisture in the air to form condensation inside the tent as temperatures drop.

* Look for sites under trees because they create a warmer, more protected microclimate that will produce lower levels of condensation.
* Avoid camping in low areas between high areas, because cool, damp air settles here; rain can also channel through and pool when a storm blows in.
* To prevent rain from blowing in, orient doors away from the wind.

## Setting up the tent
* Step 1 : Clear the debris from the tent site: Remove the things that can damage the tent floor and poke you in the backside.

* Step 2 : Lay a tarp/footprint down before putting up your tent: The goal is to put a barrier in between the ground and the bottom of your tent to protect it from gathering moisture.
* Step 3 : Lay your tent onto the tarp : Find the bottom side of the tent and put that side down on the tarp. Orient the window and door of the tent in the direction you’d like to face them while considering the above-mentioned facts as well.

* Step 4 : Connect the tent poles : Go slow with the poles because they can get tweaked or chipped. Take your time put the poles together and lay them across the flat tent.
* Step 5 : Insert tent poles into the corresponding flaps in the tent : Most basic tents will have two tent poles that cross each other to form an X that will form the basic frame of the tent.
* Step 6 : Raise the tent : With the poles connected and attached to the flaps, the next thing that you will have to do it to raise it. This task requires some coordination.

* Step 7 : Stake the tent to the ground : After raising the tent, square tent on the tarp and use metal stakes to fit through the flaps near the ground at the corners and push them into the ground. If you can’t push them in with your hand or foot, you can use a large rock for this job.

* Step 8 : Set the rainfly : The rain fly adds a cover to the tent and you should install it to keep the rain away. Some rain fly comes with separate poles for installation. Set them up according to their instructions.
