You might have gone many backpacking trips around so far, but did you ever know there are standards to pack your backpack? We all know that a poorly loaded backpack put a damper on your whole adventure since you will be carrying it for hours, days or even weeks at a time. A well-loaded pack will feel balanced when resting on your hips and won’t shift or sway as you hike with it. Therefore, it is very important to know how to pack it in the right way with efficiency, convenience and comfort in mind.

## Main storage compartments of a backpack

## Tips for packing your backpack

When loading your gear, remember to maintain comfort and convenience. Your gear must be packed comfortably so that it won’t interfere with your center of gravity as well as it should be packed conveniently so you can get the gear you need without letting everything out.

### Bottom Zone

For bulky gear and items not needed until camp.

* Sleeping bag
* Sleeping pad
* Long-wear that you need for sleep.
* Down booties

These squishy gears create an internal shock-absorption system for your back and your pack which makes comfortable when carrying.

### Core Zone

For heavy and dense gear which you won’t need to access during your hike.

* Entrees ( Main meals not snacks)
* Cooking kit
* Stove ( If you carry)
* Water reservoir (Unless you prefer bottles)
* Liquid fuel ( Make sure lid is tight and separated from food)
* Use some soft items like extra clothing, tent body, and rain-fly to fill in the gaps between bulky items.

Packing heavy items here helps to create a stable center of gravity and directs the load downward rather than backward.

### Top Zone

For bulky essentials, you might need on the trail.

* Insulated jacket/Fleet jacket and pants
* Rain jacket (Unless you have separate front pockets)
* First-aid kit
* Water filter
* Toilet supplies

You can even stash your tent to the top zone if you need fast access for it.

### Accessory Pockets

Include lid pockets, front pockets, side pockets and hip belt pockets. The availability of these pockets may depend on the brand of your pack.

Best for the essentials you’ll need urgently or often on the trail.

* Map
* Compass
* GPS
* Sunglasses
* Sunscreen
* Lip balm
* Headlamp
* Torch
* Bug spray
* Snacks
* Water bottles
* Rain-cover
* Keys (look for a clip inside one of the pockets)
* NIC and Wallet
* Power bank
* Earphones

### Tool Loops and Lash-on points

For oversized or overly long items.

* Trekking poles
* Tent poles
* Large sleeping pads
* Climbing ropes

Many packs have special tool loops, fasteners or other storage solutions for some of this gear. Daisy chains, lash patches and compression straps can also be used to wrangle gear that simply can’t be carried in any other place.

However, because this gear can snag on branches or scrape against rocks, you should minimize how many items you carry on the outside of your pack.

## How to Avoid Over-packing

Most of the backpackers face this issue of overloading his pack, even though he is not an ultralight. Have you faced the same issue? Try out this simple exercise to cut your unwanted weight.

1. Layout everything you want to take on your hike.
2. Now move the essential items to a different pile. Don’t move luxury items to this pile.
3. Then you can eliminate at least half of your gear left in the luxury pile.

Thereafter, if you have extra room in your backpack, then treat yourself with some luxuries. But if your backpack is still overloaded keep ditching some luxuries until everything fits.
