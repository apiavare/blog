## Do you follow these tips as a Backpacking Beginner?

Backpacking is the best form of low cost travelling to seek adventure, which blends hiking with back-country camping. It allows you to interact with many local communities, broaden your horizons and enrich your vision. However, as a beginner for backpacking, it is essential to stick into some basic steps to ensure an excellent outdoor experience.

Basic steps to follow for your first backpacking trip,

## 1.  Find an easy destination

The key advice here is to choose a location where the hike is not too hard; otherwise, it may cause a miserable experience. You can follow these tips to find the best destination for your first backpacking trip.

* Consult with experienced backpackers and get their suggestions.
* Pick a place close to home, so that you can spend more time hiking than driving or travelling.
* Pick a well-travelled trail and well-established camp. It is better to have some hikers and campers nearby who can give you a hand if you run into difficulties.
* Find the water availability near the camp. It is crucial to know what kind of a water source is there and is it available at the time you travel.
* Search about the weather and current situations of the destination. Talk to some locals or recent travellers and ensure the safety of the location. Always check weather forecasts and don’t hesitate to cancel or turn back if something goes wrong.

## 2.  Get essential backpacking gear

Backpacking is a low budget-traveling medium; always plan to keep your initial investment low. You can borrow or rent the priciest items such as your tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, and backpack.

Since you have to carry and fit all your gear into your backpack, they needed to be lightweight and compact. That is why it is required to organize your backpacking gear carefully. The followings are the most essential items you will need for any backpacking trip:

* **Tent**  : If you are traveling with friends always plan to share your tent because it makes your weight low and is more economical.
* **Backpack** : If you borrow or buy a pack make sure that it fits comfortably. Load it up with assorted items to about 20% of your body weight and take it out on a long test hike. If it’s comfortable on the hips and in the shoulders, then it’s fine for your first backpacking trip.
* **Sleeping bag & pad :** The necessity of a sleeping bag and the pad depends on the location you are planning to camp. If you are supposed to encounter freezing night, then a sleeping bag gives a warmer sleep.
  Similarly, a sleeping pad will provide a cushion for a comfortable night.
* **Stove** : If you can’t find wood at the camping location or the authorities have banned to make a wood fire then it’s crucial to have a stove with you. Borrowing or renting would be the best option.
* **Water Treatment** : Taking a water filter is a wise move because even the pristine-looking source of water can hide things you’d rather not drink. For further details check out our ‘Water Treatment article’.
* **Kitchen Supplies** : Scrounge enough pots, pans, plates, cups and utensils from your home kitchen to cook and eat your planned meals. A small sponge and biodegradable soap for dishwashing and a  small towel also comes in handy.

## 3.  What clothes for backpacking?

No need to buy special hiking clothes for your first backpacking trip. Simply go with your fitness wear and some clothing made of moisture-wicking, quick-drying fabrics like nylon and polyester. Moisture-wicking fabrics pull sweat away from the skin to keep you dryer. Avoid cotton, which slurps up water and takes a long time to dry.

Be mindful to bring a jacket, warm hat, gloves, and rainwear as precautions.

You can wear supportive over-the-ankle-boots or lightweight trail running shoes on your preference, which could protect your feet. By the way, carrying a pair of slippers also would be a smart choice.

## 4.  Plan your backpacking meals

If you are planning for an overnight backpacking trip, plan for the dinner, breakfast, and a couple of lunch. Always try to get some instant cooking food instead of perishable things. You can have your breakfast and lunch of the first day on your way. It is recommended to have some extra food, snacks though enough for an added day in the wilds.
