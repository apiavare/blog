If you have ever camped in rainy weather, you know how unpleasant it is to be with the soaked gear and cold nights. In fact, if you go into your camping trip prepared for rain with the right camping gear, you can enjoy every moment of it. Cuddling into your loved ones while listening to the sound of rain beating against your rainfly is one of a heavenly experience you could ever feel. Here are six tips you could follow when camping in rain to keep yourself dry and enjoy your camping.

## Be alert on weather

You should definitely be aware of the weather forecast of the area, which you’re planning to camp, prior to your departure. Checking back the forecast frequently is a smart move since the weather in the mountain areas are unpredictable and change often. Asking from the locals of that area or checking with a recent traveller to that area are some reliable sources of information, which most experienced travellers follow.

And do not hesitate to call off or postpone your trip if things went wrong and out of
your control.

## Pack up the necessary gear

Even though the weather forecast calls for dry days, but your instincts not, it is a must to take your rain gear with you. Because while you are hiking or camping, you might notice sudden winds picking up or an eerie stillness.

Therefore, it is necessary to have below items when preparing for camping in rain.

* Rain covers: It is mandatory to have rain covers to protect yourself and your backpack from rain and cold.
* Moisture-wicking clothes: Don’t bring cotton clothes since it gets damp and never drying even it’s not raining. Clothing made of fabrics like nylon or polyester will be the best option.
* Plastic bags: Big black garbage bags and airtight Ziploc-style bags will help you keep your gear dry. And to keep your soaked clothing separated from dry ones. Make sure to take some extra bags with you, because you will
  never regret it.
* Tarp: This is a compulsory item when you’re camping in rain, to make your tent waterproofed.
  Sleeping bag &amp; pad: Both the sleeping bag and the pad, will collectively ensure a dry and warm night.
* Stove: Bringing a stove would come in handy if you can’t find enough dry firewood for cooking.
* Old newspapers: Dry newspaper can be placed inside your wet shoes to speed up the drying process; it will suck the moisture out. And also works well for getting your fire started, if you are having trouble in finding tinder
  and kindling.

## Find the right camping site

Choose a campsite in an elevated, flat area at least 200 feet away from a river or lake. Because no one wants to wake up in a pool of water during a downpour. Avoid low-lying areas such as the bottom of a slope since water runs downhill. In addition, be conscious about the trees around you, whether they have falling branches if the wind picks up overnight.

## Waterproof your tent

When camping in rain, it is important to lay a heavy-duty tarp under your tent to avoid the tent getting flooded from the below. Make sure that no part of the tarp extends out from underneath your tent. If a piece of tarp sticks out from underneath the tent, the rain will strike the tarp and roll underneath the tent, where the tent floor is likely to soak it right up. Fold any excess tarp under the tent so that you cannot see any of the tarps.

Use another tarp above your tent if you do not have a rainfly. The overhanging tarp will give you extra room to hang an outside clothesline for your wet gear, a front porch for you to cook and take off your wet shoes and clothes. Fire in rain

Find bit larger logs of firewood, because even though they’re wet from outside, their core is drier. So you can cleave them and have some dry fuel for your fire. Carrying a lighter instead of a box of matches is a smarter move when camping rain. For more details check out the article ‘How to build a campfire in rain?’. However, having a stove will make your life easy in rain, incase if you fail to find some dry wood for your campfire.

## Warm sleep in the rain

Even though you already have a tarp underneath your tent, moisture is still likely to come through if the rain is heavy enough and lasts long enough. Add an extra layer of plastic (polythene) sheet inside of your tent, to overcome this problem. Moreover, a sleeping bag (or bivy bag) and a sleeping pad will give additional insulation so that, you can sleep warmer and drier.
