Ever heard of car camping? It is a bit adventive word to here in Sri Lanka. However, it is none other
than loading up your gear needed for the trip into your car, pull into a campsite and set up your tent
on a designated campground. This experience is called the ‘base camping’ as well.

Some people are confused that car camping is literally sleeping in your car, not in a tent. But no, it
isn’t necessary to be sleeping in the car, sleeping a few feet away in a tent or in a camper (RV) would
do as well. In car-camping, there is no hiking or backpacking involved when getting into your
camping site. If you are hoping for a more rural campground then you might need to have a
powerful vehicle, which can fit on to backcountry roads.

## Where can you car camp?

In Sri Lanka, typically car camping is mostly done in national parks like Yala, Wasgamuwa, Galoya,
Udawalawa, Kumana and Wilpattu. Furthermore, there are many other private camping grounds,
which allow car camping in places around Knuckles (Riverstone, Meemure), Hortain plains, Ella,
Sinharaja Rain Forest, Minneriya, Maskeliya, Poonagala and some beaches like Rekawa, Kalpitiya,
Ussangoda, Arugambay and Panama. We will more elaborate on the car-camping locations of Sri
Lanka in another article.

Most importantly, always be sure to get necessary permits from the responsible authorities (Forest
Department, Wildlife Conservation Department, or the respective private parties) and do your
reservations well in advance.

## Essential Camping Gear

Since there is no hiking or backpacking in car camping, the weight of your gear is to be of little
concern as long as it fits in your car. There is no need for skimping on any of the luxuries that would
make your camping night an unforgettable experience. Here are some tips to choose your gear.

* Tent : If you have enough budget, try to go a little bit bigger with your tent for extra
  breathing room. For example, a cozy couple can comfortably fit into a three-person tent
  while a family of four to a six-person tent. Moreover, some extra features like having a
  footprint, two doors and vestibules outside the doors will certainly ease your camping night.
* Sleeping Bag : Select your bag according to the temperature rating of the place you go to.
  However, no need to go with a super-snug mummy bag as backpackers use, a rectangular
  camping bag will give you more room to roam.
* Sleeping Pad : The sleeping pad is like the mattress on a bed, but it also has high-tech
  insulation to prevent you from losing body heat on the cold ground. There is a number of
  sleeping pad types; thicker, longer, wider and with different insulation values. So, choose
  your sleeping pad accordingly.

Tip : If you want to keep your initial investment low, try to rent or borrow the priciest items like
the tent, sleeping bags and sleeping pads.

* Lighting : You got to bring your own illumination to the campsite. A flashlight or a
  lantern would be fine, but a headlamp frees up your hands for camp tasks. And a
  campfire also will do the job but be conscious about the fire restrictions. Check out our
  article ‘How to build a campfire properly?’
* Stove : A classic two or single burner propane camp stove would suit the job. Be sure
  your fuel canister (gas cylinder) is sufficient for the purpose.
* Cooler : Make sure your cooler has enough capacity for your perishable food and cold
  food to be kept along with enough ice.
* Kitchen Supplies : Raid your home kitchen and bring everything necessary for successful
  meal preparation and consumption. In addition, you will need a scrubber,
  biodegradable soap, a towel and a small washtub.
* Camp Chairs : These are optional if you can sit at the camp picnic table, but downtime
  will be a little more enjoyable when you have a comfy place to perch. Moreover, having
  a hammock is even better, especially for afternoon naps.
* First-aid Kit : It is more important to bring a first kit alongside, because a lot of fun may
  cause accidents too. Bringing your own soap, hand sanitizer, sun protection and insect
  repellent will be a smart move.

Though the above gear are essential for you to carry with you, some developed camping grounds
have their own pre-setup tents, kitchen supplies, stoves and some other necessary equipment.
Therefore, be smart to check with campsite management beforehand.

## Meal planning for car camping

Unlike in backpacking and hiking, in car-camping, you can go with boxed or canned entrées and side
dishes or fresh food or combo of all of them. Be mindful to bring plenty of snacks.

Camping tea or coffee is not optional for many campers, you can have instant coffee or tea bags or a
tea kettle to enrich your camping experience.
